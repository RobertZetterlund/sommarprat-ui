Using [Sveriges Radio API](https://api.sr.se/api/documentation/v2/index.html) and [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/) this repo visualises spotify playlists from the hosts of Sommar i P1.

# What is sommarprat / Sommar i P1?

> Sommar i P1 is one of the biggest radio shows in Sweden and a staple in Swedish culture. Everyone knows the well-known signature and the show itself. It is on air every year during the summer, and has been ever since its start in 1959.
>
> The show is made up by interesting Swedish-speaking persons who get free hands to create their own hour and a half-long show. They get to choose their own music and what they want to talk about.
>
> Being a host on Sommar i P1 has been compared to receiving a knighthood in Sweden.

# Why

I wrote some scripts in another [repo](https://github.com/RobertZetterlund/sommarprat) where I created spotify playlists for all sommarprats since 2005. And this repository is where the results are displayed. The data is to be visualized in the landing page. Various interesting datapoints might include.

- How much does recency of release date affect the selection of ones playlist.
- Is the age of when you heard the song (i.e. it was released) important?
- Who has the most obscure music in "Sommar i P1"?
- Who has the saddest music in "Sommar i P1"?
- Which is the most played song by hosts in "Sommar i P1"?
